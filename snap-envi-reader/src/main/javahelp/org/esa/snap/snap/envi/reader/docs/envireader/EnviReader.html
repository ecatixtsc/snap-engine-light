<h3>Envi Reader</h3>

<p>The reader supports data products in the Envi data format. The products consist of pairs of a header (<i>.hdr</i>) and an
    image file. The image file must have the same file name as the the header file. As extension the following extensions are tested in
    the given order(<i>.dat</i>, <i>'&nbsp;'</i>,<i>.img</i>, <i>.bin</i>, <i>.bip</i>, <i>.bil</i> or <i>.bsq</i>). The file which is first found is used.
    <br/><br/>
    The data can also be read from a zip file. The first header file which can be found within the zip file is used.
</p>

<h3>HICO Reader</h3>

<p>The data of the <a href="http://www.sdl.usu.edu/programs/hico">HICO sensor</a> (http://www.sdl.usu.edu/programs/hico) is delivered in the
    Envi format. Beside the header and image file HICO products come along with other ancillary files like RGB, NDVI and flag file.
