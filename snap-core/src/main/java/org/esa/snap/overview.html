<p>This is the overview page of the SNAP Java API and examples documentation.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The SNAP (Meris and (A)ATSR ToolBoX) Java library comprises a development framework
    and a great number of packages containing specific, problem-oriented implementations.

<h2>The SNAP Framework API</h2>

<p>The SNAP Framework API is a core part of the SNAP API which defines all interfaces,
    classes and recurring design patterns used to implement concrete software modules such
    as the processing tools, data product readers and writers or map projections.

<p>This package provides the software frameworks used throughout the MERIS/(A)ATSR Toolbox
    software.

<p>Currently, the following framework packages exist:
<ul>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.core.datamodel} - Product in-memory resentation - <i>the most important SNAP package</i></li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.core.dataio} - Product Data I/O plug-in framework</li>
    <!-- TODO: following link does not work, cause ther is no class defined within this package-->
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.core.dataop} - Product data manipulation interfaces and design patterns</li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.core.processor} Product processing framework, used by all scientific data processors</li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.core.param} - Generalized parameter handling</li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.core.ui} - User interface (UI) related classes and sub-packages</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that all classes and packages contained in <code>org.esa.snap.framework</code> are independent
    from other <code>org.esa.snap.*</code> classes and packages.


<h2>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.util}</code> Package</h2>

This package provides several utility classes and sub-packages used throughout
the MERIS/(A)ATSR Toolbox software.

<p>
    Currently the following sub-packages exist:
<ul>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.util.io} - I/O-Utilities</li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.util.jai} - Support classes for JAI (Java Advanced Imaging API)</li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.util.math} - Mathematical helper classes</li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.util.logging} - Logging capabilities</li>
</ul>

<h2>The SNAP API Source Code Examples</h2>

The examples are available in the <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples">snap-examples repository on GitHub</a>.
Provided here is a short documentation for the Java source code examples provided along with
the SNAP Software. The examples show the basic concepts how to use the SNAP Java API
for your own applications or how to extend SNAP by writing new modules.

<p>Very simple examples showing how to read data from a product and write them out:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples/blob/master/snap-engine-examples/src/main/java/org/acme/snap/examples/data_export/BandWriterMain.java">BandWriterMain.java</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples/blob/master/snap-engine-examples/src/main/java/org/acme/snap/examples/data_export/BitmaskWriterMain.java">BitmaskWriterMain.java</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples/blob/master/snap-engine-examples/src/main/java/org/acme/snap/examples/data_export/TiePointGridWriterMain.java">TiePointGridWriterMain.java</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>A very simple NDVI (normalized differential vegetation index) processing implementation. The package contains a single source file:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples/blob/master/snap-engine-examples/src/main/java/org/acme/snap/examples/ndvi_simple/NdviSimpleMain.java">NdviSimpleMain.java</a>Â 
    </li>
</ul>

<p>A more advanced processor which uses parts of the SNAP Graph Processing Framework (GPF) can be found in the GitHub examples at
    <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples/tree/master/snap-engine-java-operator">snap-engine-java-operator</a>.
    This example is desgned to be build as SNAP module to be separately added to an existing SNAP installation.
</p>

<p>SNAP can also understand Python code. If you like to implement a processor in Python this example is for you:<br>
    <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples/tree/master/snap-engine-python-operator">snap-engine-python-operator</a>
</p>

<p>Newcomers who want to develop export tools and/or data processors are invited to look at the
    <a href="https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SNAP/Developer+Guide">Developer Guide</a> which we have prepared in our wiki.
</p>

<p>This is the list of the most important API packages used by the examples:
<ol>
    <li>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.core.datamodel}</code> package.</li>
    <li>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.core.dataio}</code> package.</li>
    <li>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.core.gpf}</code> package.</li>
    <li>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.util}</code> package.</li>
</ol>
